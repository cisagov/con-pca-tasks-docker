## Image tags ##

The images of this container are tagged with [semantic
versions](https://semver.org) of the underlying con-pca-tasks project
that they containerize.  It is recommended that most users use a version tag
(e.g. `:0.0.1`).

| Image:tag | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|`cisagov/con-pca-tasks:1.2.3`| An exact release version. |
|`cisagov/con-pca-tasks:1.2`| The most recent release matching the major and minor version numbers. |
|`cisagov/con-pca-tasks:1`| The most recent release matching the major version number. |
|`cisagov/con-pca-tasks:edge` | The most recent image built from a merge into the `develop` branch of this repository. |
|`cisagov/con-pca-tasks:nightly` | A nightly build of the `develop` branch of this repository. |
|`cisagov/con-pca-tasks:latest`| The most recent release image pushed to a container registry.  Pulling an image using the `:latest` tag [should be avoided.](https://vsupalov.com/docker-latest-tag/) |

See the [tags tab](https://hub.docker.com/r/cisagov/con-pca-tasks/tags) on

```console
docker build \
  --build-arg VERSION=0.0.1 \
  --tag cisagov/con-pca-tasks:0.0.1 \
  https://github.com/cisagov/con-pca-tasks-docker.git#develop
```

## Cross-platform builds ##

To create images that are compatible with other platforms, you can use the
[`buildx`](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/) feature of
Docker:

1. Copy the project to your machine using the `Code` button above
   or the command line:

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/cisagov/con-pca-tasks-docker.git
    cd con-pca-tasks-docker
    ```

1. Create the `Dockerfile-x` file with `buildx` platform support:

    ```console
    ./buildx-dockerfile.sh
    ```

1. Build the image using `buildx`:

    ```console
    docker buildx build \
      --file Dockerfile-x \
      --platform linux/amd64 \
      --build-arg VERSION=0.0.1 \
      --output type=docker \
      --tag cisagov/con-pca-tasks:0.0.1 .
    ```
